    "# Project Proposal — Heart Disease Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 - Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart disease and its effective diagnosis is a global health challenge. In this proposal, we aim to address diagnosing heart diseases using machine learning techniques. We will attempt to detect the presence of heart disease in patients by leveraging a heart disease dataset obtained from Kaggle. The diagnosis (presence) ranges from 0 (no presence) to 4. However, our focus will be on distinguishing between the presence and absence of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset consists of 16 variables, but we will focus on the following six variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Id (id)** : patient Id \n",
    "2. **Age (age)**: Age of the patient.\n",
    "3. **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)**: in mm Hg.\n",
    "4. **Serum Cholesterol (chol)**: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dL.\n",
    "5. **thalach (thalch)** : maximum heart rate  \n",
    "6. **Heart Disease (presence)**: representing the degree of blockages or narrowing in major vessels.\n",
    "   - P (present): < 50% diameter narrowing\n",
    "   - N (non-present): > 50% diameter narrowing\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can our K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification effectively diagnose heart disease using age, heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels?\n"
